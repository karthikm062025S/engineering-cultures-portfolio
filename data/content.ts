    heading: "The Assumption of Neutrality",
    paragraph: "Engineering is often presented as neutral. If a system works efficiently, it is assumed to be good. This view separates technical problem-solving from social or political responsibility. The readings in this course challenge that assumption by showing how values and priorities are built into design choices, even when those choices appear objective.",
    bridgingLine: "These systems often feel distant, quiet, and orderly—much like the structures we build to manage them.",

    heading: "How Design Shapes Behavior",
    paragraph: "Design decisions quietly influence how people act. Infrastructure, interfaces, and layouts guide behavior without requiring rules or enforcement. A design can encourage movement, discourage rest, or define who belongs in a space. This course shows that such outcomes are not accidental. They reflect choices about efficiency, control, and order that affect everyday life.",
    bridgingLine: "The influence of design is strongest when it goes unnoticed.",

    heading: "When Technology Requires Authority",
    paragraph: "Some technologies operate at a scale that demands centralized control. Large energy systems, transportation networks, and industrial infrastructure require strict regulation, hierarchy, and oversight to function safely. Choosing these technologies also means accepting the political structures needed to manage them. In this way, technology does not simply serve society—it shapes how society must organize itself.",
    bridgingLine: "Power becomes part of the system, not just the policy.",

    heading: "The Distance Created by Engineering Education",
    paragraph: "Engineering education emphasizes abstraction, optimization, and efficiency. While these skills are essential, they can also create distance from the real-world impacts of technical decisions. This course highlights how expertise can separate engineers from the people and environments affected by their work, making consequences easier to overlook.",
    bridgingLine: "Distance can make responsibility harder to see.",

    heading: "Why Code Is Not Neutral",
    paragraph: "The same patterns appear in software. Algorithms and digital systems make decisions about access, visibility, and risk. Although code is written in logic, it reflects assumptions about what matters and who benefits. This course makes clear that software systems carry social and environmental consequences, even when they appear purely technical.",
    bridgingLine: "What looks like computation often carries values.",
